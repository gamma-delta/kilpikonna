# Kilpikonna

Cracklepappy#4146 on the Noita Discord wondered if the eye secret was a drawing, traced
out by information encoded in the eyes somehow. So I made this little JS project to draw some
possiblities.

## How to Contribute

Anything you can, really. The code is shoddy, not all the trigrams and patterns are here,
and we can always use more strategies for drawing paths.

The project uses JS modules right now, so you can't just open the file in your browser.
Spin up a simple webserver with `python3 -m http.server` or similar to use it.

## What?

If you have no idea what that means:

- [Noita](https://noitagame.com/) is a game by Nolla Games with a secret related to patterns of eyes deep in the world.
- [FuryForged has a great video on the eye secret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lSPZWmmoS8)
- [Or join the discord](https://discord.gg/Noita), ping Harry, and ask about the "eye puzzle"
- Note this is all gigantic spoilers (but given that the greatest minds in the community have no idea what the answer
  to this puzzle is, you're not missing much by reading all this...)

## So far we have no success

:( It just draws random-looking patterns.

But if you have an idea for a better strategy please submit it via PR!

## Why the name?

"Kilpikonna" is Finnish for turtle, and this project reminds me of [Logo turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29).
